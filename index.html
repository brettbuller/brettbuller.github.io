<title>Healthy Journey Not Sprint</title>
	<body>
		<h1>Losing weight is not the goal it is the side effect of a Healthy Life</h1>
		<p>Body image issues and fad diets blanket the social media pages, the 24 hour news, and any magazine that has a cover.  At the same time these magazines push unrealistic expectations and miracle weightloss cures they also pay lip service to whole health and eating right.  But guess what?  Those don't sell as well and businesses are out there to make money. So you will get bombarded by content that has you drinking shakes and trying to live on less than 600 calories a day in order to fit in to a dress or achieve a certain look. </p>
		<br>
		<p>But here is the thing <strong>YOU ARE NOT YOUR ISSUES</strong>, you can be anyone you want and can do this starting today.</p>
		<p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square">
			Here are some things I can promise you:
				<li>It will not be easy</li>
				<li>It will not be fast</li>
				<li>You will get frustrated</li>
				<li>You will doubt yourself</li>
				<li>You will change your life</li>
				<li><strong>And you are not alone</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Set obtainable goals for yourself and reward yourself for hitting them. Don't let your first goal be run a marathon if you haven't laced up your shoes for your first run ever.  Remember, healthy is a journey not a sprint.
